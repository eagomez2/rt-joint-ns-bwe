## Abstract
Artificially extending the bandwidth of speech in band-limited scenarios using 16kHz (known as wideband) or lower sample rates such as in VoIP or some Bluetooth applications, can significantly improve its perceptual quality. Typically, clean speech is assumed as input to estimate the missing spectral information. However, such an assumption falls short if it has been contaminated by noise or reverb, resulting in audible artifacts. We propose a low-complexity multitasking neural network capable of performing noise suppression and bandwidth extension 16kHz to 48kHz (fullband) in real-time on a CPU, mitigating such issues even if the noise cannot be completely removed from the input. Instead of employing a monolithic model, we adopt a modular approach and complexity reduction methods that result in a more compact model than the sum of its parts while improving its performance.
